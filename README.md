# hello-world

Just another repository which says hello to a bright new world!

I am learning to code from scratch to help me with a business idea.  I have had a successfull teaching career for 20years, I have enjoyed every minute, however now I am bored and want a new challenge.  I have ideas which I want to bring to fruition and have embarked on a coding journey.  I am currently learning HTML, CSS and Javascript.
